Security anti-patterns and mitigation strategies
This section identifies and explores common security anti-patterns associated with the Amazon Bedrock chatbot application architecture. By recognizing these anti-patterns early in the development and deployment phases, you can implement effective mitigation strategies and fortify your security posture.

================================================

# Addressing security anti-patterns in the Amazon Bedrock chatbot application architecture is crucial for several reasons:

Data protection and privacy: The chatbot application processes and generates sensitive data, including personal information, intellectual property, and confidential business data. Failing to address security anti-patterns can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential regulatory violations.
Model integrity and reliability: Vulnerabilities in the chatbot application can enable bad actors to manipulate or exploit the underlying generative AI models, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated outputs. This can have severe consequences, particularly in decision-support or critical applications.
Responsible AI deployment: As the adoption of generative AI models continues to grow, it’s essential to maintain responsible and ethical deployment practices. Addressing security anti-patterns is crucial for maintaining trust, transparency, and accountability in the chatbot application powered by AI models.
Compliance and regulatory requirements: Many industries and regions have specific regulations and guidelines governing the use of AI technologies, data privacy, and information security. Addressing security anti-patterns is a critical step towards adhering to and maintaining compliance for the chatbot application.
The security anti-patterns that are covered in this post include:

Lack of secure authentication and access controls
Insufficient input validation and sanitization
Insecure communication channels
Inadequate prompt and response logging, auditing, and non-repudiation
Insecure data storage and access controls
Failure to secure FMs and generative AI components
Lack of responsible AI governance and ethics
Lack of comprehensive testing and validation

## Anti-pattern 1: Lack of secure authentication and access controls
In a generative AI chatbot application using Amazon Bedrock, a lack of secure authentication and access controls poses significant risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Identity spoofing and unauthorized access can enable threat actors to impersonate legitimate users or systems, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by the chatbot application, and potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the customer’s data and intellectual property used by the application.

Identity spoofing and unauthorized access are important areas to address in this architecture, as the chatbot application handles user prompts and responses, which may contain sensitive information or intellectual property. If a threat actor can impersonate a legitimate user or system, they can potentially inject malicious prompts, retrieve confidential data from the knowledge base, or even manipulate the responses generated by the Anthropic Claude 3 LLM integrated with Amazon Bedrock.

Anti-pattern examples
Exposing the Streamlit frontend interface or the API Gateway endpoint without proper authentication mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthenticated users to interact with the chatbot application and inject malicious prompts.
Storing or hardcoding AWS access keys or API credentials in the application code or configuration files, increasing the risk of credential exposure and unauthorized access to AWS services like Amazon Bedrock or DynamoDB.
Implementing weak or easily guessable passwords for administrative or service accounts with elevated privileges to access the Amazon Bedrock service or other critical components.
Lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or roles with privileged access, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources, including the Amazon Bedrock service, if credentials are compromised.
## Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with a lack of secure authentication and access controls, implement robust IAM controls, as well as continuous logging, monitoring, and threat detection mechanisms.

IAM controls:

Use industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, and integrate with AWS IAM Identity Center or other identity providers for centralized authentication and authorization for the Streamlit frontend interface and AWS API Gateway endpoints.
Implement fine-grained access controls using AWS IAM policies and resource-based policies to restrict access to only the necessary Amazon Bedrock resources, Lambda functions, and other components required for the chatbot application.
Enforce the use of MFA for all IAM users, roles, and service accounts with access to critical components like Amazon Bedrock, DynamoDB, or the Streamlit application.
Continuous logging and monitoring and threat detection:

See the Comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy section for guidance on implementing centralized logging and monitoring solutions to track and audit authentication events, access attempts, and potential unauthorized access or credential misuse across the chatbot application components and Amazon Bedrock service, as well as using CloudWatch, Lambda, and GuardDuty to detect and respond to anomalous behavior and potential threats.

## Anti-pattern 2: Insufficient input sanitization and validation
Insufficient input validation and sanitization in a generative AI chatbot application can expose the system to various threats, including injection events, data tampering, adversarial events, and data poisoning events. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and compromised model outputs.

Injection events: If user prompts or inputs aren’t properly sanitized and validated, a threat actor can potentially inject malicious code, such as SQL code, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of the DynamoDB chat history data. Additionally, if the chatbot application or components process user input without proper validation, a threat actor can potentially inject and run arbitrary code on the backend systems, compromising the entire application.

Data tampering: A threat actor can potentially modify user prompts or payloads in transit between the chatbot interface and Amazon Bedrock service, leading to unintended model responses or actions. Lack of data integrity checks can allow a threat actor to tamper with the context data exchanged between Amazon Bedrock and OpenSearch, potentially leading to incorrect or malicious search results influencing the LLM responses.

Data poisoning events: If the training data or context data used by the LLM or chatbot application isn’t properly validated and sanitized, bad actors can potentially introduce malicious or misleading data, leading to biased or compromised model outputs.

Anti-pattern examples
Failure to validate and sanitize user prompts before sending them to Amazon Bedrock, potentially leading to injection events or unintended data exposure.
Lack of input validation and sanitization for context data retrieved from OpenSearch, allowing malformed or malicious data to influence the LLM’s responses.
Insufficient sanitization of LLM-generated responses before displaying them to users, enabling potential code injection or rendering of harmful content.
Inadequate sanitization of user input in the Streamlit application or Lambda functions, failing to remove or escape special characters, code snippets, or potentially malicious patterns, enabling code injection events.
Insufficient validation and sanitization of training data or other data sources used by the LLM or chatbot application, allowing data poisoning events that can introduce malicious or misleading data, leading to biased or compromised model outputs.
Allowing unrestricted character sets, input lengths, or special characters in user prompts or data inputs, enabling adversaries to craft inputs that bypass input validation and sanitization mechanisms, potentially causing undesirable or malicious outputs.
Relying solely on deny lists for input validation, which can be quickly bypassed by adversaries, potentially leading to injection events, data tampering, or other exploit scenarios.
Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with insufficient input validation and sanitization, implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms throughout the chatbot application and its components.

Input validation and sanitization:

Implement strict input validation rules for user prompts at the chatbot interface and Amazon Bedrock service boundaries, defining allowed character sets, maximum input lengths, and disallowing special characters or code snippets. Use Amazon Bedrock’s Guardrails feature, which allows defining denied topics and content filters to remove undesirable and harmful content from user interactions with your applications.
Use allow lists instead of deny lists for input validation to maintain a more robust and comprehensive approach.
Sanitize user input by removing or escaping special characters, code snippets, or potentially malicious patterns.
Data flow validation:

Validate and sanitize data flows between components, including:
User prompts sent to the FM and responses generated by the FM and returned to the chatbot interface.
Training data, context data, and other data sources used by the FM or chatbot application.
Protective controls:

Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for input validation and protection against common web exploits.
Use AWS Shield for protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) events.
Use CloudTrail to monitor API calls to Amazon Bedrock, including InvokeModel requests.
See the Comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy section for guidance on implementing Lambda functions, Amazon EventBridge rules, and CloudWatch Logs to analyze CloudTrail logs, ingest application logs, user prompts, and responses, and integrate with incident response and SIEM solutions for detecting, investigating, and mitigating security incidents related to input validation and sanitization, including jailbreaking attempts and anomalous behavior.

## Anti-pattern 3: Insecure communication channels
Insecure communication channels between chatbot application components can expose sensitive data to interception, tampering, and unauthorized access risks. Unsecured channels enable man-in-the-middle events where threat actors intercept, modify data in transit such as user prompts, responses, and context data, leading to data tampering, malicious payload injection, and unauthorized information access.

Anti-pattern examples
Failure to use AWS PrivateLink for secure service-to-service communication within the VPC, exposing communications between Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services to potential risks over the public internet, even when using HTTPS.
Absence of data integrity checks or mechanisms to detect and prevent data tampering during transmission between components.
Failure to regularly review and update communication channel configurations, protocols, and encryption mechanisms to address emerging threats and ensure compliance with security best practices.
Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with insecure communication channels, implement secure communication mechanisms and enforce data integrity throughout the chatbot application’s components and their interactions. Proper encryption, authentication, and integrity checks should be employed to protect sensitive data in transit and help prevent unauthorized access, data tampering, and man-in-the-middle events.

Secure communication channels:

Use PrivateLink for secure service-to-service communication between Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services used in the chatbot application architecture. PrivateLink provides a private, isolated communication channel within the Amazon VPC, eliminating the need to traverse the public internet. This mitigates the risk of potential interception, tampering, or unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted between services, even when using HTTPS.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage and automate the deployment of SSL/TLS certificates used for secure communication between the chatbot frontend interface (the Streamlit application) and the API Gateway endpoint. ACM simplifies the provisioning, renewal, and deployment of SSL/TLS certificates, making sure that communication channels between the user-facing components and the backend API are securely encrypted using industry-standard protocols and up-to-date certificates.
Continuous logging and monitoring:

See the Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring Strategy section for guidance on implementing centralized logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to potential communication channel anomalies or security incidents, including monitoring communication channel metrics, API call patterns, request payloads, and response data, using AWS services like CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS WAF.
Network segmentation and isolation controls

Implement network segmentation by deploying the Amazon ECS cluster within a dedicated VPC and subnets, isolating it from other components and restricting communication based on the principle of least privilege.
Create separate subnets within the VPC for the public-facing frontend tier and the backend application tier, further isolating the components.
Use AWS security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance and subnet levels, respectively, for the ECS cluster and the frontend instances.

## Anti-pattern 4: Inadequate logging, auditing, and non-repudiation
Inadequate logging, auditing, and non-repudiation mechanisms in a generative AI chatbot application can lead to several risks, including a lack of accountability, challenges in forensic analysis, and compliance concerns. Without proper logging and auditing, it’s challenging to track user activities, diagnose issues, perform forensic analysis in case of security incidents, and demonstrate compliance with regulations or internal policies.

Anti-pattern examples
Lack of logging for data flows between components, such as user prompts sent to Amazon Bedrock, context data exchanged with OpenSearch, and responses from the LLM, hindering investigative efforts in case of security incidents or data breaches.
Insufficient logging of user activities within the chatbot application—such as sign in attempts, session duration, and actions performed—limiting the ability to track and attribute actions to specific users.
Absence of mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of logged data, allowing potential tampering or repudiation of logged events.
Failure to securely store and protect log data from unauthorized access or modification, compromising the reliability and confidentiality of log information.
Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with inadequate logging, auditing, and non-repudiation, implement comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms to capture critical events, user activities, and data flows across the chatbot application components. Additionally, measures must be taken to maintain the integrity and authenticity of log data, help prevent tampering or repudiation, and securely store and protect log information from unauthorized access.

Comprehensive logging and auditing:

See the Comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy section for detailed guidance on implementing logging mechanisms using CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, and OpenSearch Service, as well as using CloudTrail for logging and monitoring API calls, especially Amazon Bedrock API calls and other API activities within the AWS environment, using CloudWatch for monitoring Amazon Bedrock-specific metrics, and ensuring log data integrity and non-repudiation through the CloudTrail log file integrity validation feature and implementing S3 Object Lock and S3 Versioning for log data stored in Amazon S3.
Make sure that log data is securely stored and protected from unauthorized access by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encryption at rest and implementing restrictive IAM policies and resource-based policies to control access to log data.
Retain log data for an appropriate period based on compliance requirements, using CloudTrail log file integrity validation and CloudWatch Logs retention periods and data archiving capabilities.
User activity monitoring and tracking:

Use CloudTrail for logging and monitoring API calls, especially Amazon Bedrock API calls and other API activities within the AWS environment, such as API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Additionally, use CloudWatch for monitoring metrics specific to Amazon Bedrock, including the number of model invocations, latency, and error metrics (client-side errors, server-side errors, and throttling).
Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) solutions for centralized log management and real-time monitoring of security events.
Data integrity and non-repudiation:

Implement digital signatures or non-repudiation mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of logged data, minimizing tampering or repudiation of logged events. Use the CloudTrail log file integrity validation feature, which uses industry-standard algorithms (SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing) to provide non-repudiation and verify log data integrity. For log data stored in Amazon S3, enable S3 Object Lock and S3 Versioning to provide an immutable, write once, read many (WORM) data storage model, helping to prevent object deletions or modifications, and maintaining data integrity and non-repudiation. Additionally, implement S3 bucket policies and IAM policies to restrict access to log data stored in S3, further enhancing the security and non-repudiation of logged events.

## Anti-pattern 5: Insecure data storage and access controls
Insecure data storage and access controls in a generative AI chatbot application can lead to significant risks, including information disclosure, data tampering, and unauthorized access. Storing sensitive data, such as chat history, in an unencrypted or insecure manner can result in information disclosure if the data store is compromised or accessed by unauthorized entities. Additionally, a lack of proper access controls can allow unauthorized parties to access, modify, or delete data, leading to data tampering or unauthorized access.

Anti-pattern examples
Storing chat history data in DynamoDB without encryption at rest using AWS KMS customer-managed keys (CMKs).
Lack of encryption at rest using CMKs from AWS KMS for data in OpenSearch, Amazon S3, or other components that handle sensitive data.
Overly permissive access controls or lack of fine-grained access control mechanisms for the DynamoDB chat history, OpenSearch, Amazon S3, or other data stores, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
Storing sensitive data in clear text, or using insecure encryption algorithms or key management practices.
Failure to regularly review and rotate encryption keys or update access control policies to address potential security vulnerabilities or changes in access requirements.
Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with insecure data storage and access controls, implement robust encryption mechanisms, secure key management practices, and fine-grained access control policies. Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, using customer-managed encryption keys from AWS KMS, and implementing least- privilege access controls based on IAM policies and resource-based policies can significantly enhance the security and protection of data within the chatbot application architecture.

Key management and encryption at rest:

Implement AWS KMS to manage and control access to CMKs for data encryption across components like DynamoDB, OpenSearch, and Amazon S3.
Use CMKs to configure DynamoDB to automatically encrypt chat history data at rest.
Configure OpenSearch and Amazon S3 to use encryption at rest with AWS KMS CMKs for data stored in these services.
CMKs provide enhanced security and control, allowing you to create, rotate, disable, and revoke encryption keys, enabling better key isolation and separation of duties.
CMKs enable you to enforce key policies, audit key usage, and adhere to regulatory requirements or organizational policies that mandate customer-managed encryption keys.
CMKs offer portability and independence from specific services, allowing you to migrate or integrate data across multiple services while maintaining control over the encryption keys.
AWS KMS provides a centralized and secure key management solution, simplifying the management and auditing of encryption keys across various components and services.
Implement secure key management practices, including:
Regular key rotation to maintain the security of your encrypted data.
Separation of duties to make sure that no single individual has complete control over key management operations.
Strict access controls for key management operations, using IAM policies and roles to enforce the principle of least privilege.
Fine-grained access controls:

Implement fine-grained access controls for the DynamoDB chat history data store, OpenSearch, Amazon S3, and other data stores using IAM policies and roles.
Implement fine-grained access controls and define least-privilege access policies for all resources handling sensitive data, such as the DynamoDB chat history data store, OpenSearch, Amazon S3, and other data stores or services. For example, use IAM policies and resource-based policies to restrict access to specific DynamoDB tables, OpenSearch domains, and S3 buckets, limiting access to only the necessary actions (for example, read, write, and list) based on the principle of least privilege. Extend this approach to all resources handling sensitive data within the chatbot application architecture, making sure that access is granted only to the minimum required resources and actions necessary for each component or user role.
Continuous improvement:

Regularly review and update encryption configurations, access control policies, and key management practices to address potential security vulnerabilities or changes in access requirements.

## Anti-pattern 6: Failure to secure FM and generative AI components
Inadequate security measures for FMs and generative AI components in a chatbot application can lead to severe risks, including model tampering, unintended information disclosure, and denial of service. Threat actors can manipulate unsecured FMs and generative AI models to generate biased, harmful, or malicious responses, potentially causing significant harm or reputational damage.

Lack of proper access controls or input validation can result in unintended information disclosure, where sensitive data is inadvertently included in model responses. Additionally, insecure FM or generative AI components can be vulnerable to denial-of-service events, disrupting the availability of the chatbot application and impacting its functionality.

Anti-pattern examples
Insecure model fine tuning practices, such as using untrusted or compromised data sources, can lead to biased or malicious models.
Lack of continuous monitoring for FM and generative AI components, leaving them vulnerable to emerging threats or known vulnerabilities.
Lack of guardrails or safety measures to control and filter the outputs of FMs and generative AI components, potentially leading to the generation of harmful, biased, or undesirable content.
Inadequate access controls or input validation for prompts and context data sent to the FM components, increasing the risk of injection events or unintended information disclosure.
Failure to implement secure deployment practices for FM and generative AI components, including secure communication channels, encryption of model artifacts, and access controls.
Mitigation strategies
To mitigate the risks associated with inadequately secured foundational models (FMs) and generative AI components, implement secure integration mechanisms, robust model fine-tuning and deployment practices, continuous monitoring, and effective guardrails and safety measures. These mitigation strategies help prevent model tampering, unintended information disclosure, denial-of-service events, and the generation of harmful or undesirable content, while ensuring the security, reliability, and ethical alignment of the chatbot application’s generative AI capabilities.

Secure integration with LLMs and knowledge bases:

Implement secure communication channels (for example HTTPS or PrivateLink) between Amazon Bedrock, OpenSearch, and the FM components to help prevent unauthorized access or data tampering.
Implement strict input validation and sanitization for prompts and context data sent to the FM components to help prevent injection events or unintended information disclosure.
Implement access controls and least-privilege principles for the OpenSearch integration to limit the data accessible to the LLM components.

Regularly review and audit FM and generative AI components for compliance with security policies, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements.
Guardrails and safety measures
Implement guardrails, which are safety measures designed to reduce harmful outputs and align the behavior of FMs and generative AI components with human values.
Use keyword-based filtering, metric-based thresholds, human oversight, and customized guardrails tailored to the specific risks and cultural and ethical norms of each application domain.
Monitor the effectiveness of guardrails through performance benchmarking and adversarial testing.
Jailbreak robustness testing
Conduct jailbreak robustness testing by prompting the FMs and generative AI components with a diverse set of jailbreak attempts across different prohibited scenarios to identify weaknesses and improve model robustness.

## Anti-pattern 7: Lack of responsible AI governance and ethics
While the previous anti-patterns focused on technical security aspects, it is equally important to address the ethical and responsible governance of generative AI systems. Without strong governance frameworks, ethical guidelines, and accountability measures, chatbot applications can result in unintended consequences, biased outcomes, and a lack of transparency and trust.

Anti-pattern examples
Lack of an established ethical AI governance framework, including principles, policies, and processes to guide the responsible development and deployment of the generative AI chatbot application.
Insufficient measures to ensure transparency, explainability, and interpretability of the LLM and generative AI components, making it difficult to understand and audit their decision-making processes.
Absence of mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, public consultation, and consideration of societal impacts, potentially leading to a lack of trust and acceptance of the chatbot application.
Failure to address potential biases, discrimination, or unfairness in the training data, models, or outputs of the generative AI system.
Inadequate processes for testing, validation, and ongoing monitoring of the chatbot application’s ethical behavior and alignment with organizational values and societal norms.
Mitigation strategies
To minimize a lack of responsible AI governance and ethics, establish a comprehensive ethical AI governance framework, promote transparency and interpretability, engage stakeholders and consider societal impacts, address potential biases and fairness issues, implement continuous improvement and monitoring processes, and use guardrails and safety measures. These mitigation strategies help to foster trust, accountability, and ethical alignment in the development and deployment of the generative AI chatbot application, mitigating the risks of unintended consequences, biased outcomes, and a lack of transparency.

Jailbreak robustness testing:

Conduct jailbreak robustness testing by prompting the LLMs and generative AI components with a diverse set of jailbreak attempts across different prohibited scenarios to identify weaknesses and improve model robustness.

## Anti-pattern 8: Lack of comprehensive testing and validation
Inadequate testing and validation processes for the LLM system and the generative AI chatbot application can lead to unidentified vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and availability issues. Without comprehensive testing and validation, organizations might fail to detect potential security risks, functionality gaps, or scalability and performance limitations before deploying the application in a production environment.

Anti-pattern examples
Lack of functional testing to validate the correctness and completeness of the LLM’s responses and the chatbot application’s features and functionalities.
Insufficient performance testing to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, or scalability limitations under various load conditions.
Absence of security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and adversarial testing to uncover potential security vulnerabilities or model exploits.
Failure to incorporate automated testing and validation processes into a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, leading to manual and one-time testing efforts that might overlook critical issues.
Inadequate testing of the chatbot application’s integration with external services and components, such as Amazon Bedrock, OpenSearch, and DynamoDB, potentially leading to compatibility issues or data integrity problems.
Mitigation strategies
To address the lack of comprehensive testing and validation, implement a robust testing strategy encompassing functional, performance, security, and integration testing. Integrate automated testing into a CI/CD pipeline, conduct security testing like threat modeling and penetration testing, and use adversarial validation techniques.

Stay current with security best practices, guidance, and updates from AWS and industry organizations regarding logging, auditing, and non-repudiation for generative AI applications.

======================================================

In this target state architecture, unauthenticated users interact with the chatbot application through the frontend interface (1), where it’s crucial to mitigate the anti-pattern of insufficient input validation and sanitization by implementing secure coding practices and input validation. The user inputs are then processed through AWS Shield, AWS WAF, and CloudFront (2), which provide DDoS protection, web application firewall capabilities, and a content delivery network, respectively. These services help mitigate insufficient input validation, web exploits, and lack of comprehensive testing by using AWS WAF for input validation and conducting regular security testing.

The user requests are then routed through API Gateway (3), which acts as the entry point for the chatbot application, facilitating API connections to the Streamlit frontend. To address anti-patterns related to authentication, insecure communication, and LLM security, it’s essential to implement secure authentication protocols, HTTPS/TLS, access controls, and input validation within API Gateway. Communication between the VPC resources and API Gateway is secured through VPC endpoints (4), using PrivateLink for secure private communication and attaching endpoint policies to control which AWS principals can access the API Gateway service (8), mitigating the insecure communication channels anti-pattern.

The Streamlit application (5) is hosted on Amazon ECS in a private subnet within the VPC. It hosts the frontend interface and must implement secure coding practices and input validation to mitigate insufficient input validation and sanitization. User inputs are then processed by Lambda (6), a serverless compute service hosted within the VPC, which connects to Amazon Bedrock, OpenSearch, and DynamoDB through VPC endpoints (7). These VPC endpoints have endpoint policies attached to control access, enabling secure private communication between the Lambda function and the services, mitigating the insecure communication channels anti-pattern. Within Lambda, strict input validation rules, allow-lists, and user input sanitization are implemented to address the input validation anti-pattern.

User requests from the chatbot application are sent to Amazon Bedrock (12), a generative AI solution that powers the LLM capabilities. To mitigate the failure to secure FM and generative AI components anti-pattern, secure communication channels, input validation, and sanitization for prompts and context data must be implemented when interacting with Amazon Bedrock.

Amazon Bedrock interacts with OpenSearch Service (9) using Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases to retrieve relevant context data for the user’s question. The knowledge base is created by ingesting public documents from Amazon S3 (10). To mitigate the anti-pattern of insecure data storage and access controls, implement encryption at rest using AWS KMS and fine-grained IAM policies and roles for access control within OpenSearch Service. Titan Embeddings (11) are the format of the vector embeddings, which represent the documents stored in Amazon S3. The vector format enables similarity calculation and retrieval of relevant information (12). To address the failure to secure FM and generative AI components anti-pattern, secure integration with Titan Embeddings and input data validation should be implemented.

The knowledge base data, user prompts, and context data are processed by Amazon Bedrock (13) with the Claude 3 LLM (14). To address the anti-patterns of failure to secure FM and generative AI components, as well as lack of responsible AI governance and ethics, secure communication channels, input validation, ethical AI governance frameworks, transparency and interpretability measures, stakeholder engagement, bias mitigation, and guardrails like Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock should be implemented.

The generated responses and recommendations are then stored and retrieved in Amazon DynamoDB (15) by the Lambda function. To mitigate insecure data storage and access, encrypting data at rest with AWS KMS (16) and implement fine-grained access controls through IAM policies and roles.

Comprehensive logging, auditing, and monitoring mechanisms are provided by CloudTrail (17), CloudWatch (18), and AWS Config (19) to address the inadequate logging, auditing, and non-repudiation anti-pattern. See the Comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy section for detailed guidance on implementing comprehensive logging, auditing, and monitoring mechanisms using CloudTrail, CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, and AWS Config to address the inadequate logging, auditing, and non-repudiation anti-pattern; including logging API calls made to Amazon Bedrock service, monitoring Amazon Bedrock-specific metrics, capturing and analyzing Bedrock invocation logs, and monitoring and auditing the configuration of resources related to the chatbot application and Amazon Bedrock service.

IAM (20) plays a crucial role in the overall architecture and in mitigating anti-patterns related to authentication and insecure data storage and access. IAM roles and permissions are critical in enforcing secure authentication mechanisms, least privilege access, multi-factor authentication, and robust credential management across the various components of the chatbot application. Additionally, service control policies (SCPs) can be configured to restrict access to specific models or knowledge bases within Amazon Bedrock, preventing unauthorized access or use of sensitive intellectual property.

Finally, GuardDuty (21), Amazon Inspector (22), Security Hub (23), and Security Lake (24) have been included as additional recommended services to further enhance the security posture of the chatbot application. GuardDuty (21) provides threat detection across the control and data planes, Amazon Inspector (22) enables vulnerability assessments and continuous monitoring of Amazon ECS and Lambda workloads. Security Hub (23) offers centralized security posture management and compliance checks, while Security Lake (24) acts as a centralized data lake for log analysis, integrated with CloudTrail and SecurityHub.
