# Security Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Secure RAG Chatbot architecture.

## Security Architecture Overview

The RAG Chatbot implements a defense-in-depth security strategy with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Network Security**: VPC, subnets, security groups, VPC endpoints
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, output encoding, secure coding practices
3. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure storage
4. **Identity and Access Management**: IAM roles, policies, least privilege
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails and threat detection
6. **AI Safety**: Guardrails, content filtering, responsible AI practices

## Security Controls Implementation

### 1. Network Security

#### VPC Configuration
- **Private Subnets**: Application components run in private subnets
- **Public Subnets**: Only load balancers and NAT gateways in public subnets
- **VPC Endpoints**: Secure private communication with AWS services
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive rules with least privilege access

#### Network Segmentation
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Public Subnet │    │  Private Subnet │
│                 │    │                 │
│  - ALB          │    │  - ECS Tasks    │
│  - NAT Gateway  │    │  - Lambda       │
│                 │    │  - OpenSearch   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2. Application Security

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
```python
def sanitize_input(text: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks"""
    # Remove dangerous characters
    dangerous_chars = ['<', '>', '"', "'", '&', '\x00', '\r', '\n']
    for char in dangerous_chars:
        text = text.replace(char, '')
    
    # Remove prompt injection patterns
    injection_patterns = [
        r'ignore\s+previous\s+instructions',
        r'system\s+prompt',
        r'you\s+are\s+now',
        r'forget\s+everything'
    ]
    
    for pattern in injection_patterns:
        text = re.sub(pattern, '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    
    return text.strip()
```

#### Output Encoding
- All user inputs are properly encoded before processing
- HTML entities are escaped in responses
- JSON responses are properly formatted

### 3. Data Security

#### Encryption at Rest
- **S3**: Server-side encryption with KMS
- **DynamoDB**: Encryption at rest with KMS
- **OpenSearch**: Encryption at rest with KMS
- **EBS Volumes**: Encryption with KMS

#### Encryption in Transit
- **HTTPS/TLS 1.2+**: All communications encrypted
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private communication channels
- **API Gateway**: TLS termination and re-encryption

#### Key Management
```yaml
KMS Configuration:
  - Customer-managed keys
  - Key rotation enabled
  - Fine-grained access control
  - Audit logging
```

### 4. Identity and Access Management

#### IAM Roles and Policies
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Service Roles**: Specific roles for each service
- **Cross-Service Access**: Controlled through IAM policies
- **Temporary Credentials**: STS for short-term access

#### Access Control Examples
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:region::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

#### Comprehensive Logging
- **CloudTrail**: API calls and user activity
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Application and system logs
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic analysis
- **WAF Logs**: Web application firewall events

#### Security Monitoring
- **Security Hub**: Centralized security findings
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection and analysis
- **Inspector**: Vulnerability assessments
- **Config**: Resource configuration monitoring

### 6. AI Safety and Responsible AI

#### Bedrock Guardrails
```python
# Guardrails configuration
guardrails_config = {
    "content_policy": {
        "filters": ["inappropriate", "harmful", "offensive"]
    },
    "word_policy": {
        "managed_word_lists": ["PROFANITY"]
    },
    "topic_policy": {
        "restricted_topics": ["sensitive_information", "personal_data"]
    }
}
```

- Input validation for prompt injection
- Output filtering for inappropriate content
- Context-aware response generation
- Bias detection and mitigation
